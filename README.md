Howdy Friends! Im Clover1k, the goober who loves chonkers(cats).
The only coding language I know is python.
If you need to contact me you can ask for my discord.
If you want me to create something for you we might be able to negotiate,
Just remember, i am a beginner and am not that great at coding,
but either way it is one of my favorite activities!

If you have any ideas of what i should code next or improvments
on current projects that I have made, please tell me!
You can give me feedback & critisism as long as you are
not trying to be rude, you can give me negative
feedback just please don't do it to be rude.

See ya'll!
